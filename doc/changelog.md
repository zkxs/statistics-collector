## 2021-11-15
This change disables `user_id` tracking. All other fields are still being tracked.

This change has been made due to a Neos Guidelines change. The [2021-11-11 guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G_-PaxSp8rGYeHUIXK-19b2VqOLlpOZ18e7DrOwNjG4/edit)
(confusingly released publicly on 2021-11-14) include the following:
> The use of any on-platform system to track users in Neos is only allowed with the knowledge and consent of all users being tracked directly or indirectly.

> Users must be explicitly informed when they are tracked and the purpose of the tracking through on-platform request dialogues or have the information readily available when the user makes use of the item, avatar, world, or experience.
